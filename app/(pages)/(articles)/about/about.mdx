As of 2023, I am a student in Year 11, enroute to finishing my high school journey, with the largest obstacle â€” VCE â€” still in the way.

### Current Projects

1. I am currently a Year 11 student studying at <CustomLink href="https://cgs.vic.edu.au">Camberwell Grammar School</CustomLink>.
2. On <CustomLink href="/">this website</CustomLink>, I showcase myself as well as some other projects, including this <CustomLink href="/stock-dashboard">stock dashboard</CustomLink>.
3. I also try to invest in stocks, so if you have any advice, feel free to share it ðŸ˜Š

However, I feel like I should probably be looking for a job or maybe even starting a small business to earn some money at this age.

### VCE

As with every other student, this period is quite daunting to me. It feels quite surreal that I'm finishing school so soon, but I hope I make the most of these final 2 years.

For reference, my VCE subjects are:

- English Language
- Mathematical Methods
- Specialist Mathematics
- Chinese Second Language
- Chemistry
- Physics

I'm doing Methods and Chinese a year early in Year 11.

### Other Stuff

I am quite invested in following sports (not so much playing them).

My soccer/football team is Manchester City and I watch just about all their games. In AFL I go for the Swans and it was rather depressing watching them crumble against Geelong last year.

Otherwise, my life is rather boring I'd say, I don't go out all that often and most of the time I'm just sat at my workstation literally AFK.

If you want any advice on tech/productivity, I'm great at recommending stuff, not so good at following advice.
