Yesterday was one of the greatest nights of my life.

### Twice concert

#### The background

As a massive fan of the K-pop group Twice (especially my ult bias Tzuyu), hearing that they'd come to Melbourne was literally a dream come true (because barely any groups come here). But when they released the tickets some time in March, I didn't get them (too busy in class) and I thought that would be it. It was disappointing, because no matter how many times I could say "it is what it is", it's still hard to let such a once in a lifetime opportunity just pass up so easily like that.

Tickets are very hard to come by, so between March and this week I put the concert at the back of my mind. As the concert slowly approached, more and more people were asking if I had gotten tickets, to which I would respond "no". But just this week, I started to think more optimistically.

#### Getting lucky

This is such a great chance to meet my favourite group, how could I pass it up so easily? I decided that this year, I wasn't going to let up opportunities so easily and live my life with no regrets, especially not one this big.

Literally this Friday I started browsing for tickets. Big thanks to the many people who helped out as well. There was a soundcheck ticket at RRP which would've been amazing, but by the time I got in contact, it had been sold.

Then on Saturday morning, my friend told me he had saw more tickets being sold officially and told me to take a look. I couldn't believe my luck, a legit 3rd row ticket at RRP - really close to his seats as well - was on offer. So, I immediately snatched at that opportunity, bought it and felt a mixture of so much delight and relief at the same time.

#### The concert

I tried to record as many memories as possible at the concert so that I would be able to relieve them as many times as I want in the future.

Seeing them in person feels so surreal, it's like so unbelieveable that people so famous are right there. Overall, it was such a great experience and I will be forever grateful for how lucky I was to be able to watch Twice and especially Tzuyu perform live.

The only, *tiny* blemish of a near-perfect experience is that due to my stupidity, I didn't bring a power bank and my phone died in the last performance of "SIGNAL", and that was when Tzuyu came up right close to us as well. That corrupted my recording of it and I guess I won't be able to cherish that memory forever.

But I guess you can't have everything right?

#### A small thing

One thing this has made me realise is that despite my usual introverted nature, I still feel best when I'm outside and enjoying life, not when I'm closed off by myself.

### Plans for next week

1. Talk about Twice with everyone
2. Talk more Twice with everyone
3. Fully support my friends

DM me 'ephemeral' if you see this.
