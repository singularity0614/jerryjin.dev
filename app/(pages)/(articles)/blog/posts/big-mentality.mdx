I'm not usually a big thinker, but maybe it's time to think bigger.

### My push 

So, next week are the science olympiads (Physics is actually tmrw) and I definitely have not given up, however just like every other week, I've been feeling just really up and down with my optimism and motivation towards them.

I need to actually find the true motivation for doing this stuff, then I might actually put my mind to it. I mean it seems obvious doesn't it, if it's something that you enjoy and will probably have a big impact on you, of course you'd try harder. But I can't tell if it works the same way for me. I'm just very stuck in worrying about what I'm feeling right now, not what I will feel later on.

### Renewing

One of my slightly OCD habtis is I like keeping things new, aesthetic, tidy and minimalist (sounds like everyone's dream). I like polishing up systems in my house (e.g. process of studying, process of washing clothes) so that everything works seamlessly, as well as maintaining environments that are very organised and feel nice to be in. I always see people online with really nice looking plants and views and I'm always so sad that I can't achieve that sort of look in my room.

Also, I *really* love throwing away old things and replacing them with new, refreshing and better overall things. For me personally, I wouldn't say I get to attached to things like old clothes, old devices and even if they are slightly nostalgic, I'd gladly go ahead and replace them if they are not worth having anymore.

### Some *productive* stuff 

I always find it amazing how well videos on days in a life of uni students do, as well as all those videos on study habits, timetabling hacks and desk setups suited towards uni/med school students or software engineers.

But sometimes I really wish there was more content focused on how to help out high school students like me. None of us have freedoms to have "Lunch with X" or "Social gathering with Y" every other day and so those tips just never seem to work. Instead we sit through 7 hours a day of school, then go home and do homework. It's not like we can really block out 4 hours in the middle of the day to study and then spend 3 hours doing other stuff because we spend all that time already at school.

Anyways, I ended up pre-ordering <CustomLink href="https://amzn.to/3DxWmXx" type="amazon">Ali Abdaal's Feel-Good Productivity</CustomLink> which hopefully has some stuff that could end up improving my efficiency and joy in doing work. But it does come out January 2024 so it will be quite a while until then.

### Plans for next week

1. Turn into some üêê of science 
2. Get back on track with the schedule 
3. Find inspiration for room design

DM me 'visionary' if you see this.
