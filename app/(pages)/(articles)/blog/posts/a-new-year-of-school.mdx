The new school year has just started, and moving into Year 11, there have been some major changes to my schooling life.

### VCE

First of all, we have just commenced studying fully in VCE, and although it seems rather daunting, these first few days have actually been quite enjoyable. I'd say what makes VCE (slightly) fun is the fact that you choose which subjects to learn, meaning I can finally do subjects I like to learn, not stuff like history or geography (thank god!).

As I stated in my <CustomLink href="/about">about me</CustomLink> page, I am taking:

* English Language
* Mathematical Methods
* Specialist Mathematics
* Chinese Second Language
* Chemistry
* Physics

All of these classes except for Chinese have been really interesting and fun for me, with the content in them being particularly engaging. Chinese, is just annoying. Don't bother putting yourself through so much pain unless you know you can score high (unlike me).

### Chinese School

For the first time in 13 years (!!!) I'm not going to Chinese School this year. The main reasons for this is:

1. I already have a Chinese tutor
2. Preparing for Chinese School work is the least of my priorities
3. I "forgot" to do the holiday homework

The thought of having my Saturday afternoons free for the whole year has literally rejuvenated me greatly, finally I have the time to do what I want over the weekends without sacrificing too much knowledge.

### Holidays

That was probably the last full summer holidays I'll have in my life. Even though the thought of that is pretty depressing, I will try to look back on it with a positive light and be grateful for them.

I got to go to Sydney, watch the Australian Open, see kangaroos and koalas, and even made a new friend in the AO season (wow, so impressive for an introvert, idk if they'd call me a friend).

Honestly, I didn't achieve as much as I thought I would over the holidays. I thought I would finish memorising Chinese orals, become some chess grandmaster and go crazy with stocks. I've only done one of those things (thank you AAPL), but overall the holidays are more about rest than they are about working, so I don't really mind.
