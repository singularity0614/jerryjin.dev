Lost in the harsh reality.

### Don't know what to do

To be honest, I've really spent a lot of this week just without motivation to do anything, mainly just spending most of my time at home, but not doing much. As it was with last week, waking up at like midday and then not doing too much for the rest of the day, with the hours just ticking by steadily.

I'm like half stuck between wanting to just forget about most things and leave reality, but also wanting to consolidate my knowledge and focus only on my studies.

Thing is we have like a SAC on the first day back, and this mentality has to change one way or another before that day. If it doesn't, well I might just regret this obsession for a long time. So I'm taking it as a bit of a warning and wake-up call.

### Socially stuck

Definitely on most of the days I've gone out, I felt much better than when I was stuck indoors with no one to talk to. Which is really strange, because I thought I was heavily introverted, but that might just be a byproduct of COVID and lockdowns keeping us inside and apart for so long. To be fair, I think before COVID I was more social than I am now, so maybe I can go back to that. Or maybe it's more like I've just gotten better at controlling when I need to be with others vs being alone.

### Plans for next week

1. Snap out of it (if possible, maybe not)
2. Fix the sleep (at least get it to pre-holidays schedule)
3. Hey.

DM me 'suburbia' if you see this.
