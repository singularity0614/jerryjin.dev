Typing this on my new keyboard and it is sooooo smooth. Anyways, let's talk about planning.

### Scheduling time

Ok, so due to a recent wave of binge watching productivity-based content, I'm going to try some new strategies to maintain focus. This one I take from KharmaMedic which is drawing up a calendar and plotting each day with the stuff I'm going to learning and revising. Obviously, with a lot of these study/revision hacks, they seem so achieveable in the first few days, but then slowly after a while, they never seem to stick. The thing is, I genuinely can never tell if these types of things are beneficial at all, or if they are just placebo. Reviews of these techniques are always so mixed, so I swear it's always a trial and error situation.

My plan is to just use this for my 3/4s, because they are the most important subjects for me right now. The other subjects can just fall into place whenever they fit. I've tried to plan out what will go on from here till November, so we'll see how we go with it. Right now, I may be falling slightly behind already given that I've spent like an hour coming up with this blog (yes it takes that long). But we'll see how to goes on from here.

### Conflicted

Also, I swear my feeling right now towards everything is so conflicted. My confidence towards my 3/4 subjects are just up and down and my imposter syndrome is kicking at an all time high. My relationships with others are also just feeling slightly off and despite the fact nothing has affected them. It might just be the stress of everything getting to me, but I've never felt so up and down before in my life.

### Keyboard

Well, maybe the biggest positive from this week was that I finished building this keyboard which took absolutely ages. The main reason behind that is I think I lube switches at about half the rate normal people do and that took up a lot of time. No matter, I did put in some effort everyday and on Saturday, I finished it off. I can't lie, it feels so smooth and *creamy* to type on and sounds very nice, so that's a major improvement.

### Plans for next week

1. Stick to the schedule
2. Connect with others even more
3. Come up with something to do in my spare time

DM me 'quixotic' if you see this.
