Again, sorry about the non-existent headers.

Welp, on the trip to Sydney, we were looking for some parking near Bondi Beach at 3:30pm, just to visit the famous beach for a little bit. It's pretty busy and parking is pretty hard to find, so imagine the delight when we found a place right next to the beach, seemingly with no issues. There was a 2P sign, but we were not going to stay for more than 2 hours at all.

It was too good to be true, wasn't it? Well, an hour later when we arrived back, a $280 fine was tucked under the windscreen wiper.

### Update March 2023

Well, it doesn't seem like I'll ever finish this story haha.

Anyways, headers are up.
