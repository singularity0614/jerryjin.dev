Now it's the halfway point of the year.

### Review

As I predicted based off previous observations, my performance in Term 2 did fall off a bit compared to Term 1. I've started to feel the full force of VCE and it does seem like the workload required has increased quite a bit.

The thing about some subjects of VCE, is that the top-end is so tight that even if you get results like losing 1 mark, it could have some implication of falling down the ranks quite severely. Obviously, its a good score and anyone should be content with it, but if you are aiming for the top, then it does matter a lot more than other people might think.

But rather annoyingly, I feel like the subjects that I'm good at (maths, science) all have this tight at the top nature, but the subjects I'm less proficient at (Eng Lang, Chinese) are a lot more skill-based rather than luck-based. But then again, it's probably like that for everyone and that gives all the subjects their competitive natures.

### Talk the talk, walk the walk

Every holidays, I think I always have in my mind some magical plan to do stuff. Something along the lines of, going to do X of this and Y of that everyday. This way I can feel productive, get ahead and be happier.

But putting it into action never works, I just fall back to the sleep until midday, watch YouTube for 20 hours mentality. At the end of the holidays, I 100% am going to look back and think, I could have done so much more, but I did not. But then again, this is also my choice, so I can't lament it.

### Plans for next week

1. Come up with somethings to do
2. Try not to fall into the trap of addiction
3. Sleepppppp

DM me 'equanimity' if you see this.
