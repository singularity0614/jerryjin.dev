How to get to the end?

### Shaky

Let's check, there's what like 9 days left (until oral at least)? Well, time has certainly been moving extremely fast this year and it has definitely made its prescence known now.

Now, I'm not too sure about how to feel, on one hand it is of course scary that its so close, but on the other hand if it comes quickly then it goes by quickly right? In 2 weeks I won't have to think about this anymore. It's just a last jitter to get over the line.

### Momentum

From watching sports, I've realised momentum is actually such a key point in general. When you're carrying a lot of momentum with you, you just keep hitting. But as soon as you make one small mistake or allow the momentum to swing, it suddenly feels like everything is against you and it's really hard to shake that feeling. I feel like over these holidays my momentum has swung back and forth, but unfortunately it has been in more a backwards phase. So, I guess I need to start doing the small things right to try shift some momentum back going forwards.

### Plans for next week

1. Enjoy the last week of the holidays
2. Start to get back into some form of routine
3. Do it for myself

DM me 'yeah' if you see this.
