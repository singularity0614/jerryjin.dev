Sometimes I believe it's best just to let time do its thing.

### Getting over bumps

Whenever I'm faced with something which is slightly nerve-wracking, say an exam or something, I try not to let it consume my mind. It's definitely not good if I'm just constantly being stressed out by the mere fact that the event is approaching. What I try to think instead is say like, "in 24 hours I will be able to do whatever I want" or similar.

Of course you can't purely focus on the feeling of freedom afterwards, otherwise you might lose touch with the task at hand. But I do find it genuinely comforting that I'm not too concerned about things and that tough events will just come and go quickly.

### Getting started

A major problem with me is that I have all these big aspirations to do X, Y and Z, but either I can never get started or I don't know where to start. I've been taking a look at competitive programming, or just learning algorithms in general for a long time now, but like the routes to take are so numerous, I'm just not sure which is the best one and consequently I don't take any.

Like do I learn C++ because that's what most people use when they're good? Or do I learn data structures and algorithms first in a language that I know? But what if some other language has better native features than the one I use? And what platform/styles of questions do I practice with? Too many questions, too little progress.

### Man City

We finallyyyyyyy won the Champions League!!! I was so nervous after we took the lead, but just like with anything else, I kept assuring myself that if it stayed as it is, after another few minutes we would finally be crowned champions. I remember in 2019, coming back from a holiday and watching the Tottenham 4-3 game live on the way home. Probably the most depressing day supporting Man City in my life.

### Plans for next week

1. Try to stay focused despite not having much school
2. Learn some physics and chem for olympiads
3. Start recording down more things (second brain)

DM me 'euphoria' if you see this.
