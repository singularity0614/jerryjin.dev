Apologies for the very late blog, some Physics project has been an absolute nightmare.

### Dawning upon me

Well, it's the start of Term 3, and therefore the second last term of the year. It has really flown by fast. Our 3/4 end of year exams are around the start to middle of Term 4, which now means there is really only one term left of learning in those subjects and then it will be exam time. The urgency of everything has really hit me now. Especially with doing two 3/4s, it's basically 4 months straight of hardcore work starting now.

Also, the Physics and Chemistry Olympiads are only in 2 weeks (like bruh). Physics is screwed, mainly because we haven't been taught any of the content required and as soon as I tried to learn it myself, it made me want to die. Chemistry is slightly better, but similarly to Physics, we've slightly been neglected in terms of teaching so I've had to learn most of the stuff myself, be it accurately or not. I guess we'll see how it goes in 2 weeks.

### Stupid planning

For this Physics projcet, I decided that instead of a standard PowerPoint presentation, I wanted to make an animation. Well, clearly I underestimated the difficulty of it all and definitely bit off a lot more than I could chew. Instead of me doing it all in a night as I had planned, I basically stayed up till 2am three nights in a row animating, recording and editing. At least one of those nights I was watching Alcaraz beat Djokovic which boosted dopamine.

But I think this really compromised my health, I've been feeling sick and tired these past few days which is not good at all. Other than that, I've come to realise that what I submitted probably isn't even going to do well, so it could just be all this effort for nothing. But, I'm just mainly proud of my dedication to try finish that, I don't think I've ever actually put my mind on something for 3 nights in a row, doing about 5 hours of work on it each night.

### Plans for next week

1. It's not all doom and gloom
2. Savour in the moment
3. Find something fun to do

DM me 'density' if you see this.
