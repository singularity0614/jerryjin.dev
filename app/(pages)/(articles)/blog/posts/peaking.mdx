Time is running fast and it's important to make sure I'm not too early or late.

### The right time

#### Studying

These are the last few weeks of Term 3 approaching and it's definitely the business end of the term. We've already done our last Methods SAC (woohoo), but 2 more Chinese SACs in back to back weeks to go means it's definitely time to put my head down and work a little harder than usual.

Realistically, I only need to sacrifice these 1 or 2 weeks of free time and then I can rest up a little after that, before exam grind starts. But you know, let's see what I can do.

#### Relaxing

This weekend, I was actually pretty busy, going out on both days for basically the whole day. And though it's kinda still in the middle of the term, given the fact that Methods had finished, I felt like it was fine to do. Especially going to Melbourne Uni open day, it was fun meeting up with many friends and just wandering around the campus and city, a good break from learning I'd say.

### The wrong time

#### Studying

The times I usually peak in terms of my learning previously was always around Term 1 and Term 4 I'd say. The winter terms are a bit rougher. So, if that trend continues, I guess it would be sort of good given exams are later on, but also I'd much rather just be consistent throughout the whole year instead of having this variance.

I'm also for like, kinda the first time ever, actually prioritising subjects. I used to just try at everything, which is of course ideal. But right now is not ideal, so I think I've kinda gotta reduce my throttle on subjects in exchange for extra power on others i.e., my 3/4s.

#### Relaxing

But in the midst of all this chaos, I also need to find the right times to relax and chill a little. Again, after this Methods SAC, it feels like I can have a small break from Maths for the meantime, mainly because there's no more learning to do and it's just revision from here til November.

But I don't think I can afford too much time to relax like I did in previous holidays, given that this is the final stretch. I'm basically gaslighting myself that I will have the best summer holidays in my life yet later on, so this isn't too bad.

### Plans for next week

1. Grind that Chinese
2. Find my CAS
3. Plan an actual time
