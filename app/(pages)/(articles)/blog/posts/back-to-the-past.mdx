Well a change in season also marks the start of the exam season.

### Comfort in the past

Recently, I've been watching (and rewatching) a lot more videos on uni life, tech and desk setups, something which I kinda stopped doing for a while, but I definitely did a lot of before. I don't know, something about rewinding to when I was in year 7 and 8, watching those types of videos, filling my mind up with stuff to buy and things to do in order to achieve productivity and aesthetics, I think it keeps me grounded from all this stressful studying and exams.

So, because of this second wave, I'm now *inspired* to make my setup even greater and to build the ultimate productivity system so that I become ever more efficient. Mind you, this is definitely a lot of BS and I'm definitely not trying to gaslight my mind into justifying that this not a complete waste of time.

### Travel

Also, ever since lockdown, I haven't been overseas and it's been slightly nagging me. This is mainly because with all the mock exams and stuff taking place during the holidays, there's just less and less opportunities to go away for a bit. But, I actually really miss leaving the country (totally not jealous as well haha), given that it's been nearly 4 years since I actually did that, and 4 years in Melbourne does get extremely boring. Like, really boring and the weather is terrible for three-quarters of the year.

### Something extra

Donate <CustomLink href="https://www.thepushupchallenge.com.au/fundraisers/jerryjin/the-push-up-challenge">here</CustomLink> if you want to, but it's fine if you don't, I'm just mainly doing it for myself anyways.

### Plans for next week

1. Try not to fail every exam I have
2. Hope Man City finally wins the champions league
3. Reduce (if possible) consumption of those college life and *aesthetic* setup videos

DM me 'ubiquitous' if you see this.
