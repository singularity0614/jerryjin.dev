So this week was extremely uneventful.

### Nothing to read

This is gonna be a short read because there is actually nothing to talk about. But below are some things of note:

- I garnered an average of 16 hours of screen time per day for this first week
- Slightly concerning for some people, but I've already given up on controlling it
- My sleep is also massively screwed up, but I've given up on that as well
- Sinner is a massive L, Alcaraz is the true goat of the game
- Man City are actually just too good

### Plans for next week

1. Stop procrastinating and start working (or attempt to)
2. Relish the last week of the break
3. "Fix" my sleep

DM me 'redundant' if you see this.
