That's the first week gone, this is gonna be short.

### One week down

Well, I don't know how to feel about that week. On one hand, it was really nice to finally not have to worry about anything school related for a bit and to sleep in to whenever I want (finally adequate sleep). I've spent most of it waiting for stuff to arrive (custom keyboard wooo), but haven't really found much else to do. Waking up at like 12pm everyday is quite weird, because it's already halfway during the day and after like another 10 or so hours it feels like the day has already ended.

Also there were no sports this week to watch other than like some footy on the weekend (Robbie Fox the massive troll) and these insignificant tennis competitions. At least next week, I can watch Alcaraz and Kyrgios at Wimbledon.

### Where do we go

Not gonna lie, I haven't done too much on this website due to:

- My incompetency at coding (terrible at it)
- Lack of time
- Lack of ideas

I heard Google Domains is being sold to Squarespace, so if that complicates any processes, I mighttttt pull the website, but that will only be if Squarespace makes me subscribe to something which is stupid. Also, I feel like I change the underlying code quite a bit, but it doesn't reflect to any changes UI or UX wise. I'll see what I do, in 5 weeks there will be a new pagination thing, so I guess that might look cool.

Also WTF Apple $3 trillion company, what a missed opportunity. Always trust $AAPL.

### Plans for next week

1. Go outside and exercise a bit more
2. Try not to fall sick (starting to feel like it)
3. Find something to put on this website
