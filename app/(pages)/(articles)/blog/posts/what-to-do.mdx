So, what is there to do now?

### Not much

The thing with the first week of the holidays is that our school is amongst a minority that have 3 weeks of holidays in spring which means that there's basically nothing to do. This first week has really just blown past so quickly and I don't feel like I've done anything. It basically feels as if we have a 2 week holiday, but just with a bit more of a breather.

### Slacking

Another contributor to how fast time has just gone past is that despite my best intentions, I've still managed to find a way to just eat up time, whether it be through watching YouTube, browsing Reddit/Twitter (or X whatever) or investing in things that have taken away around 20 hours of my life.

### 4am activities

Somehow my sleep has just been pushed further and further back which ain't the best. Usually, I wouldn't be too worried because this is just a holiday phase and surely I'd be alright by the time school starts right? The only problem is that last holidays, I pushed back to around 1-2am and it somehow spread to my actual school sleep schedule. That better not be the case with this because I'm not sure if I'd survive on like at most 4 hours of sleep a day (sounds extremely degenerate). So you know, I better find a way to cure this. Maybe getting rid of my 2am YouTube/movie/social media sessions might help. But what are the chances I'd actually do that?

### Plans for next week

1. Try to fix that 4am bedtime
2. Become heartless and drop that obsession (maybe)
3. Connect with others

DM me 'fluffy' if you see this.
