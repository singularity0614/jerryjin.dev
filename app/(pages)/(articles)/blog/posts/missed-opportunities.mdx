You either look back or look forward.

### Tale of two sciences

Basically, the Physics olympiad was a complete disaster, but the Chemistry one was more fine. The Physics one, given that I had minimal preparation, I did not expect to do that well. But holy was it on a whole other level of tragic. I sat there with my head overheating trying to just comprehend half the questions, never mind solve them.

Chemistry, was quite a lot more straight-forward, but then again it was probably straight-forward for everyone else, meaning making stupid mistakes really isn't an option. But, that made all the preparation I did feel slightly useless, because none of the "harder" stuff I prepared for showed up and it was all pretty standard stuff.

It does feel like another one of those scenarios where I focused on the wrong thing i.e., putting more work in Physics might have improved my performance there and putting less work in Chemistry porbably wouldn't have affected me too much.

Given that this year was realistically our one and only shot, it does slightly feel like an opportunity missed, but we move.

### Weekends

Friday night, no doubt, is the best time of the week. Especially this year, given I moved by tutoring to after school on Friday, after I'm done with that, I'm done for the week. Last year (and basically every year before that), I had Chinese school on Saturday afternoon, which meant Friday night was actually just a time to panic over homework and stuff, whereas now I can chill.

The lack of Chinese school (or any other tutoring for that matter) has resulted in my weekends being practically free, except for sport when that's on. It certainly feels amazing having all this free time and I definitely wouldn't want to go back to what it was like before.

However, I feel like with all this time, I can do so much during the weekends, yet somehow I always manage to not do anything. Friday night, the whole of Saturday and pretty much up until 8pm Sunday is just me playing games, binging YouTube and what not. It's not until 8pm Sunday when I'm hit with the realisation of the amount of work I could've done, should've done, but didn't do. And then I have to cram it into like 5 hours of semi-distracted work and my mind fills with regret.

But I'd say overall, the biggest problem about this isn't getting the work done, it's just the feeling of regret. So, if you feel bad about not doing work one day, don't be, trust me. If it does annoy you, finding one day to draw up a schedule for say the next month, detailing stuff to do each night might help out and is something I should try do (on top of my 3/4 schedule).

### Around the corner

Also on Wednesday, our Chinese oral dates got given to us, and we have less than 9 weeks till that fateful day. Given that there is now a concrete target and deadline to work to now, reality has really kicked in.

### Plans for next week

1. Start caring about school work
2. Fix my eyesight
3. Appreciate the weather while it lasts
