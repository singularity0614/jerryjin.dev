Three down, one to go.

### Review

This term, much like all of this year to be honest, has just flown by so quickly. It literally feels like a few days ago where I was complaining about the start of school again and now it's already over. But despite how fast it felt, I also do feel like I've done quite a bit this term.

First and foremost, I've finished up all my 3/4 SACs which to me, feels like 50% of the journey for a VCE subject. Even though of course it's far from the end, I definitely do want to sort of celebrate every achievement a little so it's good that I can appreciate the fact that I have hit this milestone.

And in just stuff outside of pure VCE, it has been a pretty good term. The last post probably has details on some of the biggest achievements I've made this year and I do hope that I can sort of build on it. And I also feel like I'm improving on a personal level which is good as well. I don't think I've been this active in going out for a long time (probs since pre-COVID).

### Final sprint

We have a three week holiday this time, which in previous years would have been spent on enjoying life, appreciating rest and not thinking at all about school. Unfortunately, the situation this year is largely different to those previous years, in that there are final exams to prepare for. Basically this means I gotta actually be a bit disciplined and try etch out a bit of work per day.

My main motivation for all of this is that given how long I've spent on all these subjects and stuff, I can't just let myself get comfortable and perform not at my best during probably the most important part of the year. So hopefully this sort of mindset can push me to at work hard during these holidays and then I can get myself over the line.

### Plans for next week

1. Watch the Apple Event
2. Stick to a schedule
3. Try not to lose my eyesight
