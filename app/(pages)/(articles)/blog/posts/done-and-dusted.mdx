It has been quite the few weeks.

### Done with school

In a blink of an eye, Year 11 is over. It's really quite crazy to think about how fast this whole year has blown by, especially given how daunting everything first seemed at the start of the year. 

### Plans for next week

1. Nothing

DM me 'fulfilling' if you see this.
