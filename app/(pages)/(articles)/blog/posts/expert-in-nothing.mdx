Jack of all trades, master of none.

### Extending past mediocrity

Something that I have alluded to before is that apart from maths (which isn't even that far ahead), I genuinely don't have many advantages over anyone else. Like, I'm that type of guy who is an A in quite a few things, but is rarely that A+ in them. This isn't limited to academics either, it's the same with sports, decent at all of them, not the best at any of them.

Well, I've decided that apart from my maths, I'm going to try up my science abilities this year, mainly by partaking in the Chemistry and Physics Olympiads to try advance my achievements. To be fair, I used to do science fairs and stuff outside of school, but recently I've just never really had the opportunity to extend myself so fortunately for me, I can actually try do that this year.

Of course, I wish that I could become *the best* at everything I do, even though that's a pretty unlikely scenario. The problem right now is that I don't think I have the true desire to excel, not even at coding which I have always felt like I could do really well in.

### Flawed management

Another *small* issue I have is management. Despite my management being a complete mess, I'm somewhat confident in my abilities to achieve good results thorugh following my own plans, although my performance in a recent Methods SAC may be indicative that I do need some structure because otherwise I'll start choking things I should not.

My toxic trait is that I spend most of my time planning and thinking about what I'm going to do, but just not doing it. I'm sure I'm not alone, but I feel like this actually affects me far more than what people think. Like I'll think that "I can't complete this if this isn't done first", and then it'll go on like a loop until I just don't do anything and then my planning falls apart.

So, in the future, I'm going to try apply the two-minute rule, which is basically if the task takes less than two minutes to do, I'll just do it and get it out of the way first. Hopefully I can overcome any hesitation to do work through this method.

### A side note

Also, these blogs are starting to take up quite a lot of time (oop), but I think it's okay to sacrifice some working time as it really is like a journal and can:

1. Help me let out my thoughts and emotions
2. Provide a record for me to look back on
3. Hopefully provide some reassurance or relatability for others

### Plans for next week

1. Try not to watch the French Open too much
2. Maybe start to get on that exam grind
3. Repay my debts

DM me 'panacea' if you see this.
