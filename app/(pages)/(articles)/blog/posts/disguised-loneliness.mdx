In the midst of my busy school life, I always feel somewhat disconnected from others now.

### Friends vs classmates

The distinguishing factor between what makes someone your friend and someone your classmate in my opinion is what you talk about outside of the classroom. Being able to discuss hobbies, activities, social lives, etc. really helps elevate someone to that true friend status.

Recently, I've been feeling that my communications with some people have increasingly become more about just school things, something I've really tried to avoid. The problem with this is that it becomes sort of like a business relationship, something that exists to mutually benefit each other only in studies.

I think the key to success in Year 11 and 12 will be to maintain that balance of school and life, but as my connections become increasingly more school related, I feel like this balance is starting to tilt a bit too much.

### Rarity of meeting in-person

Of course, I still do have many people who I would consider to be actual friends, given that we discuss much more than just school life and academics. But I feel like the number of opportunities I get to meet them in person is diminishing really quickly.

Most of these friends are from my old schools, which I rarely visit so I haven't met them in-person in a long time. I still message them and have voice chats with them, but it really feels different from a few years ago, when we could actually meet up together.

And I have never really have had the chance to talk to some others that often, never mind FaceTime or meet up in person. Realistically the only people I meet nowadays are my classmates, which shouldn't be depressing, but I'd love to get away from having my whole life being concerned with school.

### Plans for next week

1. DO MORE CHINESE!!!
2. Recover from perpetual sickness
3. Talk to others more
