The prequel to the sequel I guess. Last week I was relieved to have overcome many difficult challenges, this week I'm instead preparing to overcome more challenges.

### Too good to be true

Well, Year 11 is supposed to be a huge step up from Year 10. All the teachers have talked about the increased workload and increased pressure that comes from this rise up in year level. But strangely enough, I've felt like I haven't even done that much this year in terms of studying. Now the problem is, does this mean that I'm managing my workload well and getting things done efficiently. Or am I compromising my future self by not doing excess revision/practice and instead having a daily screen time of 16 hours (lmao).

Hopefully it is the first scenario, although I am starting feel like there are elements of the second scenario slowly creeping into my mind now.

### The week ahead

This week is a rather strange one for me. Tuesday I have house athletics, so that's the whole day gone. Wednesday I have PE in the afternoon, essentially the time after lunch gone. Thursday there are round 2 of parent teacher interviews and school ends at 12:30pm, meaning the time after lunch is definitely gone. I plan to visit my old school during this time.

Friday I have a Chemistry test in the morning, English Language essay in between recess and lunch and a Maths Methods SAC in the afternoon. So basically I have a whole week of no learning and then three tests piled on the same day. How fun!

Honestly it feels kinda weird, because obviously I want to enjoy those breaks from school and such, but having three tests at the end of the week might just mean that I spend all that time with my mind stuck on thinking about those things forever, which I really want to avoid.

### PRIME

So I got my hands on some PRIME from the local Woolies and gave it a try. There were only four flavours available, lemon-lime, orange, tropical punch and ice pop, of which ice pop was already sold out. I decided to get tropical punch as one of my friends already got the lemon-lime and orange seemed too plain.

#### Review

I can't lie, I was kind of expecting that Gatorade taste to PRIME, like a strong fruity taste. First whiff of the drink, it kinda smelt like some sweet medication which was a bit of a surprise. Then when I drank it, it was hella sweet and I really could not taste any tropical punch flavour at all. It just tasted like sugary syrup. Overall, I'd give it 4/10.

### Plans for next week

1. Become THAT guy on Friday and ace (or fail) three tests
2. Meet some old friends
3. Get encouraged to not get too distracted

DM me 'chonky' if you see this.
