So, we have returned back to "normal" life this week.

### Back to the norm

Unfortunately, the holidays have finally ended and that has meant, to my annoyance, I actually have to start working now.

Term 2 often picks up straight from the off because it is just a continuation of Term 1. So that means we're going straight back into the tests and what not, without much of a grace period.

Also, I decided to sign up for the Melbourne Uni Maths Comp, so there's that to look forward to as well.

### Polishing up

There's some things that needed to be worked on, so I decided to take the time to work on some stuff.

- Organising my productivity system. Did some things connecting apps together and syncing them up so that I wouldn't have to duplicate things like to-dos and calendars.
- Fixing my setup. I bought some bits and pieces just to fill in some missing things.
- This site. I changed the articles to use MDX instead of Markdown, but I also did break the resume page.
- Stonks. I converted my USD back to AUD so I can actually use it, but the exchange rate is meh.

One thing I definitely need to fix is my screen-time, it is still atrocious, but what can you do?

### Plans for next week

1. Focus on the work-life balance
2. Join some extracurricular activities
3. Be more grateful for what I have

DM me 'mellifluous' if you see this.
