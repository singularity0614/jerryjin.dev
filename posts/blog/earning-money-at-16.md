Well, lets test these headers.

### This is a Heading

#### This is a Subheading

Looks like they work! That took quite a while.

Meanwhile, recently I have been dabbling in the money making process to make some pocket money.

At 16, you're normally expected to start working a part-time job, say at McDonald's, both to earn money and to gain some valuable work experience. It helps with developing necessary life skills (communication, problem solving, etc...) which fundamentally are the basis of many jobs, whether at a McDonald's or as a doctor.

But..., I am yet to work a job, so instead I have been looking at some other revenue streams.

### Amazon Affliates

I signed up for <CustomLink href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com.au">Amazon Affliates</CustomLink> yesterday, having taken some advice from (one of my favourite YouTubers) <CustomLink href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal">Ali Abdaal's</CustomLink> YouTube videos. It might not generate much money at all, but I feel like giving it a try is never a bad idea.

I have linked some of the tech products I used in my <CustomLink href="/tech">tech</CustomLink> page, and maybe one person will buy something from there :P

### Google AdSense

This might be a risky move, but I also applied this website to <CustomLink href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">Google AdSense</CustomLink>, so hopefully I can make some money from hosting this website. Realistically, I'd want to make enough to cover the costs of running this website, including the Google Cloud and Google Domains fees.

But I do acknowledge that if ads do appear, it will probably worsen the experience of browsing on this website, so if I start covering costs elsewhere, I will cancel the ads.

### Stocks

I've invested in stocks since Year 8, and I actually have made quite a bit from them. For a school computing project, I even created a stock dashboard to monitor stocks and filter them in different ways.

Before, I invested in stocks from the ASX, but recently, I started looking at shares in the US market, namely Apple and other tech companies whose values have fallen drastically recently.

So now I have the majority of my money invested in Apple shares, and I hope they grow well in the future.

### For the Future

Realistically, I still should apply for a part-time job in the near future, because of the various benefits it would bring. I've been thinking of working at a tuition place, because my maths skills are strong and I'd believe it would be the one thing I could actually do.

But whatever I do, I just hope it doesn't consume too much time, otherwise my studies could be compromised, and that would not be ideal.
