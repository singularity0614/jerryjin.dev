Generally, the feeling after a test/exam is always mixed, some people look back with worry, regret, some with relief, happiness, but for me, I'm usually just very non-chalant.

### Calming the mind

It is what it is - I think that's becoming my signature phrase to cope/deal with everything, even though I'll probably be bashed by some of you for saying it to everything.

But it's generally how I feel about most things nowadays, after I've done a test or something, I can't change anything about what I did. Realistically, my results are just a reflection of my preparation and it's not like I somehow deserve more than what I get. If I prepare well, then I know I'll do well and my results should be a reflection of that. If my marks aren't there, well it just means I didn't prepare enough and that's my fault, not the fault of anything else. Then I'll know for next time that clearly there were issues in my preparation and I'll work to rectify that immediately.

Of course, sometimes you feel like luck was not on your side that day, but what can you really do about it? Certainly, I'd feel extremely frustrated, especially as each one of these SACs count towards our final ATAR, and having a monumental stuff up could just mean ends for me. And this is definitely applicable to much more than just school. But for me, apart from the first reflections, dwelling on the past can just be a waste of time and mental space. Nothing in the past is going to be changed, wishing for it to change just isn't the best move to be made.

So that's basically my whole spiel on my feelings after experiencing any challenging moment. Perhaps I'm too emotionally insensitive, I certainly could see why you would think that. Maybe it's just my introverted personality coming through. But only on rare occasions do I ever feel like I crack from performing badly.

### Superstitions

Ok this part is gonna be kind of weird, I'm not an avid believer in the supernatural. However, I feel like somethings in my life have a correlation with each other, and whether this is for the better or worse, I'm yet to find out.

The first one is the weather, generally I feel like if it is a sunny day, I'm a lot happier, a lot more productive and things just go better for me. On the contrary, if it's raining and cloudy, I feel sadder, I do a lot less work and I generally just ponder about life instead of doing anything useful.

The second one is my team, if Man City win, it's gonna be a great day. However, if Man City lose, I already feel like the day has gotten off to the worst start possible. I get that this may be overly dramatic and that I probably shouldn't believe my whole life is tied to the performance of one team, but it is what it is.

### Arc Browser

Short segment, recently (thanks to friends), I have switched over to Arc Browser and have been using it as a replacement for Chrome/Edge, which I used before. I also tried to use SigmaOS for a week, but gave up on that really quickly. I feel like Arc is a very well-polished new way to browser and some of its features like peek are very well thought out.

### Plans for next week

1. Don't stress over anything
2. Think and act postively
3. Go do some exercise
