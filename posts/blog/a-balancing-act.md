So we're in the middle of a long weekend, which I have spent *mostly* working on school work.

### Sacrificing rest

Usually you look forward to a long weekend. Who doesn't? But unfortunately for me, right after this long weekend is a Chinese SAC, and it's an oral (like bruh). Well, instead of doing your typical long weekend things e.g., going out with friends, playing sport/games etc., I have been practicing this oral.

To me, it has made the weekend ever so slightly depressing given that coming into it, I knew I wouldn't be spending these three days doing something I liked. But indeed what has to be done, has to be done and I approached this break with the mindset that doing well on this SAC probably means a lot more in the end than a few days of chatting and games.

Of course, this doesn't guarantee I do well on the SAC at all, after all my Chinese is still quite questionable. But as long as I don't go out of this long weekend with any regrets about missed opportunities, I should feel fine (hopefully).

### The bigger picture

This whole year, I feel like I've understood the need for better mental health, rather than just constantly focusing on studying. I've seen a lot of people with many tutors that they go to each week and if it works for them, I have no problem with it. Just for me personally though, I felt like some tutors didn't bring me much benefit, for example Chinese school and this other Methods tutor, so I decided to drop them because their ROI would've been pretty bad.

All those previous years, I felt like these tutors were always something I dreaded, not something which I looked forward to and helped me a lot.

Also, I feel like focusing on aspects of my social life would probably help out a lot with healthily "distracting" me from a constant academic focus. Again this year, I've tried to do just that, although I may slightly be tipping the balance the other way a bit too much now (if you know, you know about the watch texting). But I've definitely noticed I've kind of cruised through the term so far, and it's 100% made me feel much more relaxed and calm about VCE.

### Plans for next week

1. Cry when I fail Chinese
2. Cry harder and mald
3. Maybe FaceTime or meetup with old friends (been ages)
