This year was one of the better years for me, both in terms of my academics as well as my well-being. The biggest change was probably the end of lockdowns, being free for the whole year certainly improved my social life.

Even though I rarely follow them, my New Year's resolution would probably be to get into exercising more, with the mentality that I want to become a fit and strong person. From reading <CustomLink href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</CustomLink>, I have realised the importance of changing the way of thinking about maintaining habits. It's no longer want I desire to do, more what I desire to be, and these habits will help me become like that.

I'm starting off the next year with a trip to Sydney, which will probably help with the holiday mood, but after that, holiday homework and preparations for school will take priority.

I can't quite figure out how to get the contents and headings to work on here right now, so for now there will be no headings.
