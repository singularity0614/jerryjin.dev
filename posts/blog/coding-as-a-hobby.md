title: Coding as a hobby

I've coded since I was 14 and it has undoubtedly brought many benefits to my life. From being able to express myself online, to automating tedious tasks, here are some of the coding projects I've undertaken as a hobby recently.

### This Website

This website is definitely the coding project I have worked the hardest, and longest on. I've garnered some of the web development skills I learnt from school and created this as an 'everything' type of website. It hosts my blog, my about me, my school computing project and is a great place for me to experiment with some things.

I took inspiration from many online to curate this site and it has enabled me to showcase myself both in terms of skill and expression.

### Stock Dashboard

This was a project made for a school, term-long assignment, in which we were free to choose from programming in web development, game development or electronics.

I chose to web development, and since in a commerce class we were playing an ASX sharemarket game (and that I was investing in shares), I decided to create a place to view some stocks as well as to filter them by their trends. Originally I also planned to create an AI predictor, but I  was already satisfied with what I had done, so I decided not to pursue it.

In the end, I received an 'A' for my work, which I was satisfied with, given that I basically fell short of my original plan.

### Solar Panel Data

This was a small project, which taught me not only some python skills, but also how to use a raspberry pi as a server. I wrote a script to retrieve and plot data from the solar panels of my house and deployed it on a raspberry pi, so that I could have a real-time visualisation of the power my solar panels were generating.

### Manim

This was perhaps my first venture into code when I was in Year 8, where I used 3Blue1Brown's library, Manim, for animating some videos. It wasn't to hard to learn, and it was my first foray into code so the outcomes were very nice in my opinion. I even used it in a science assessment and got full marks for it!

### Conclusion

Coding has been a really fun way for me to build up some hobbies, as well as a great way for me to show off some skills I've learnt. I hope anyone reading this tries out coding, given that the future we will live in will probably rely on computers and technology more than anything else.

F.Y.I. If you're unsure of where to start from, I would recommend learning Python, as it is more straightforward and can be leveraged to do almost anything.
