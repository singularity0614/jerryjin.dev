Well, we are officially halfway through the first term of Year 11, a scary thought to be honest given that it honestly doesn't quite feel that real yet.

### The first tests

It is inevitable that tests crop up during this period of the term, the first of many for the year. I already did a chemistry test (which annoyingly apparently counted for nothing), but in the upcoming weeks, there will be tests in English Language, Chinese, Specialist Maths and Physics.

I feel semi-conflicted, on one hand it has truly been quite a long while since the holidays started, yet everything still feels as relaxed and casual as though the new term had just begun. Time is a strange thing, it goes by so slowly each day, but each day goes by so fast. Each week to me now feels like it passes by so quickly, even though each day feels like it doesn't end.

### Looking ahead

Something else truly terrifying, is the fact that in order to reach the next summer holidays, I will have needed to finished two VCE 3/4 subjects which are Chinese and Methods. It feels as though they are some endgame boss that you need to defeat in order to progress to the next level.

At the end of this year, some of my old friends will have graduated and I will have one more year of school left. It's honestly so surreal to think about, these years of school just went by so fast and now they are nearly over. 2024 feels as close as it ever has been.

### Self-improvement

Another thing related to time passing by, is sleep. I genuinely get way too little sleep per night, mainly because I just have that "I could be doing other stuff" thought process. But that is really flawed, so much of the body's natural functions rely on getting enough sleep and I feel like what I'm doing is prioritising the wrong things in life. Health should come first and I've yet to fully realise this, but I'll continue to work on fixing myself up.

### Plans for next week

1. Pray to the heavens for Chinese
2. Socialise more (encouraged by a friend to do this)
3. Dwell on things less
