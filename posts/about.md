As of 2023, I am a student in Year 11, enroute to finishing my high school journey, with the largest obstacle â€” VCE â€” still in the way.

### Current Projects

<ol className="text-lg list-decimal list-inside mb-6">

    <li className="mb-1">I am currently a Year 11 student studying at <CustomLink href="https://cgs.vic.edu.au">Camberwell Grammar School</CustomLink>.</li>

    <li className="mb-1">On <CustomLink href="/">this website</CustomLink>, I showcase myself as well as some other projects, including this <CustomLink href="/stockdashboard">stock dashboard</CustomLink>.</li>

    <li className="mb-1">I also try to invest in stocks, so if you have any advice, feel free to share it ðŸ˜Š</li>

</ol>

However, I feel like I should probably be looking for a job or maybe even starting a small business to earn some money at this age.

### VCE

As with every other student, this period is quite daunting to me. It feels quite surreal that I'm finishing school so soon, but I hope I make the most of these final 2 years.

For reference, my VCE subjects are:

<ul className="text-lg list-disc list-inside mb-6">

    <li className="mb-1">English Language</li>

    <li className="mb-1">Mathematical Methods</li>

    <li className="mb-1">Specialist Mathematics</li>

    <li className="mb-1">Chinese Second Language</li>

    <li className="mb-1">Chemistry</li>

    <li className="mb-1">Physics</li>

</ul>

I'm doing Methods and Chinese a year early in Year 11.

### Other Stuff
