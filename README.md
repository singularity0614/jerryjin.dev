## Personal Website

This is a project to create a website for myself.

[Link to the website.](www.jerryjin.dev) 

### Independent Project

Currently, I am using this website to build my independent project for my computing subject at school.
It is a stock dashboard with filter and search mechanics.

### Other stuff

I redesigned most of website with NextJS recently, and have been adding some more pages to it.

Hopefully I can monetise it.

### Credits

Built with [NextJS](www.nextjs.org) and hosted with [Google Cloud](cloud.google.com).
